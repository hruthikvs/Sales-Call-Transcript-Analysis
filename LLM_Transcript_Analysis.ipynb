            "**ICP Fitment: 2/2** - Justification: The prospect, Milano, represents a motor group in the UK and was referred by a key industry contact (Simon from Nxt). They have a current need for improved vehicle visuals, as they are not fully utilizing 360° imagery on their website despite having the equipment. They are actively selling cars and listing them on Autotrader, indicating a desire to enhance their online presence. The products offered align well with the prospect's business and the initial conversation suggests a good fit for Spine's solutions.\n",

Milano explicitly states interest in improving their website's presentation to sell more cars. He is also looking for a solution that requires minimal effort. However, the deal completion timing is uncertain. While Milano expresses interest and promises to review the platform and Big Motion World, he doesn't commit to a specific timeframe for making a decision. He mentions contacting them again potentially on Monday, but that's just to continue the discussion, not necessarily close the deal.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Budget & Authority: 1/2** - Justification: Milano directly asks about pricing, indicating budget awareness. He also shows an understanding of their current sales volume (40-50 cars/month) and total inventory (80 cars). While he does have authority as he is the chairman of Europe, the fact that he wants to review the platform and compare it with Big Motion World indicates that there might be other stakeholders involved in the decision-making process.\n",
