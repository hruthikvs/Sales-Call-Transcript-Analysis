I'm just removing the background so that you can see where I am right now just inside of box. Giving you a demonstration. But... Yeah. So just a bit of a internet problem on my end. Just going to share my screen now. And show you what we have to offer. Just just give me a confirmation, let me start seeing the presentation on your end. Just a sec. Okay. I hope it should be visible No. Is that is is existing invisible sort of just just let me know if this and I can move forward

Start Time: 00:05:53
Speaker: Saurabh (Seller: True)
Text: That's it's

Start Time: 00:05:54
Speaker: Anurag (Seller: True)
Text: good Okay. So This... What is see on the screen is basically the console. It's the web version of our platform. So as a dealer, many of the smaller dealers who process very few cars, they choose to do this manually. That click their just upload it process it, download it, use it wherever they want. So we create this Ui platform for any dealer to access all the cards, all the images, all the videos, that they have ever processed and manage it at one source. Now at spine, are multiple ways in which a dealership can send over their images for processing. Very first way is through an app. We have our spine app that's available on ios a Us add on end. Right? You can use that app to click your images, your three sixty, it's a guided shoot We click those images It's uploaded to our servers and we process it for you. Secondly of getting the input is through the console. As I said, you can come here upload your pictures get processed. And the third way, the last way to get these images is through an integration with your Dns. So we'll integrate with your systems. Will not change your processes at all. The moment you upload emails to your Dns, we'll pick it up, process it, send it back to you. So there are three ways in which you can get the input, give forward the input to us. Now let me just show you one example here. We have also, you know, taken the liberty to process some of your cards as well, sort of will be sharing that, once I'm done with this walk through of the plan. Call. But let's look at a few examples here. Now if you look at this one, this is an input that we got from which is standard input we got from one of the dealers. This is a combination of a video of the car itself. And a few images of the interior and a few miscellaneous shots. So, as a data, when you... You're processing these images. Get an option to choose a background that you want. So you... We have three choice of background, three categories of background. The first is called a turn background where you can choose a background where there's a tone table in the center. You have a showroom background, let's see if you want to give the three d showroom feeling to your, you know images, and an outdoor background as well where you can choose to show your cars in know, particular outdoor environment, which we have seen many dealers. So choose choose that, option as well. At the same time, we have number plate mask as an option where you can mask number plates, put in your Logo or you can just blur it out if you want to. So this is another customization that you get. Now, as you see, we have the exterior three sixty video as an input. The dealership, it's a little buggy, my, so it will be a little slower on your end. But, again, it's a very smooth three sixteen input that the dealer has saving me. And the images. Now if you see there are no exterior shots, no exterior images that the dealership are has given it to us. What I'll do process? Processing would take somewhere about a few seconds. But depends on the load that we get, a number of vehicles that you send us. We can deliver every vehicle with twenty thirty images in every, about ten minutes so so. So that's the output time, but processing takes about five, six seconds. And if there is a lighter load, the output will be faster you. Now if you look at the output that we have generated here, this is... This was the input, which is shot in a parking lot. So they are obviously background disturbances. You choose your background, and this is what you get in return. It's a very straightforward process, not a lot to do from your end. And if you look at what we're are doing with this we are picking this car, putting in the studio, and we're adding this reflections hard and short shadows on the bottom of... On the flooring itself, making it a natural appeal to the images. If you also look at these Windows. I'll just slide it for you. If you look at this Windows, also processing the see throughs for you. So if I process this, this is the output that you get. So this one the exterior very natural looking, look... Let's look at the interiors as well. Whatever background that you choose, we will be matching your interiors with that particular background. So let's see if your background has maybe some elements on the wall, maybe a Led lighting on the wall. This background, this processing will have those Led elements or those designs on the wall itself, making it feel like. It's an interior shot in the studio itself So this is the image product of ours. Since we are looking at these images, I'll show what we can do for three sixty as well. So fill all these images from the video. As you saw, we did not have the exterior shots, we generated those exterior shots right from the video itself. And what we do is we pick up about thirty to seventy such images. Process them, combine them and create a three sixty for you. Okay. So this is the type of three sixty that you get with spine, very smooth very easy to use and go directly on your website. Integrations. So these are the two core products we have We also have a video product as well, you know, that's something that'll I'll show you post this. But any any feedback as of now that you have on these two products.

Text: Perfect. So this... These are the two products. Let me also show the video as well since not any questions on these two. So video do, for what we need guys is the unique identification number of the card, which is the V, Vin number. If you give us a vin number, we'll get all the information about the car that the manufacturer you may provide any additional information such as the current mileage. You know, any financing options, the pricing, we, get it from your internal systems, or we give you that option to enter it on the system itself. And using that, we create these walk videos. Now you can choose from a bunch of templates that we have. We have several templates and they're open to creating new templates for you based on any color theme that you have for your website. And these videos are highly customizable with different choice of voice overs, language, background music, and the content itself in different languages. Let me show this one to you Anu

Text: Anu, we lost you actually.

Start Time: 00:13:24
Speaker: Anurag (Seller: True)
Text: I guess, am my audible? Sort of yep. Perfect. Yeah. Sort of I think you can also sue the output that we have generated, from some of the inputs on the website. Just give us a few seconds.

Start Time: 00:13:38
Speaker: Saurabh (Seller: True)
Text: Yeah. So, guys, what we have Done, know? I just picked one sample from your website itself So this was a car, I mean, Know, we just had up. As an example. So we need at least eight exterior, you know, images of a car. From that, you know, if you think you don't have that bandwidth or something, you know, to shoot a workaround video of a car. But you can, at least click the images. So this is the out you know, we can generate it for you. Definitely, you know, the frames that you can see. So it's a we speech the Ai speech the, you know, all of the images. It's not that kind of smooth, like, as an, when you shoot the, you know, video, but, yeah, we... You know, the Ai is able to at least make a three sixty out of the images. Just to... I mean, save your time or something. So, yeah, we can create this kind of output for you.

Start Time: 00:14:23
Speaker: Anurag (Seller: True)
Text: So this is... This... If you also click on gallery, sort of on the bottom. Right? Yeah. This is... So these are the outputs that you can from the eighty images that well, we have on your website. So these are individual outputs. And we just merge them out, create that three sixty admin. So the input that you gave us was a combination of video and a few inter... In interior shots. But even if give us some exterior shots and interior shots, just images will create this as sixty three. Has that's the problem.

This is, again, I mean, again, this car was showed you outside, if you can see, it was been into a yard or something the car was short. And this is the. You know, we were able to generate on this can see, you know the windows was loop open over. So still, the Ai is able to catch this kind of thing. Because the Ai is trending that way. But moreover, we have hot feature So hotspot is something, you know the Ai detects the feature of the car. Yeah. So that's one thing. If in case, there's a dent on the car. Let's say there was a dent, So manually, you can add the dent as well. So, I mean, the logo will be, I mean, it will be in an orange or something format. So we can do that. So that's all about, you know, the three sixty of the car. Not just that, if you wish to, you know, have an interior of the car. So this is the interior would look like. But for interior, there's a, requirement of and recruit Camera. It's a hardware that we would, like you to have. So, you know, This is the output be able to generate. The client can interact with this. This is not something, you know, auto rotating or something. He can... The client can interact, however, they want to.
