Duration: 52 minutes

[14:00:03] Michael Chen (Sales Rep): Hi, this is Michael from PeopleFirst Solutions. Is this Jennifer?

[14:00:08] Jennifer Martinez (Buyer): Yes, this is Jennifer Martinez. Hi Michael.

[14:00:12] Michael Chen: Thanks for making the time today, Jennifer. I know as Global HR Director at TechGrowth, your schedule must be packed. Is this still a good time for our discussion?

[14:00:25] Jennifer Martinez: Yes, thanks Michael. I've blocked an hour. Actually, I've got my team leads from APAC and EMEA joining us in about 15 minutes, if that's okay?

[14:00:35] Michael Chen: Perfect, that would be great. Before they join, could you give me an overview of what's driving your search for a new HR platform?

[14:00:48] Jennifer Martinez: *sighs* Where to start? We've grown from 2,000 to 8,500 employees in just 18 months. We're using three different HR systems that don't talk to each other, our performance review process is basically held together with spreadsheets, and our recruiting team is drowning in manual work.

[14:01:15] Michael Chen: That's significant growth. Could you walk me through your current systems?

[14:01:22] Jennifer Martinez: Sure. We're using Workday for core HR in North America, but our APAC offices are on a local solution called HR-Link, and Europe is still using an old custom system from when we acquired TechVision GmbH last year. It's a nightmare for reporting.

[14:01:45] Michael Chen: How is this affecting your day-to-day operations?

[14:02:00] Jennifer Martinez: Well, just last week, our CEO asked for global headcount numbers by department, and it took my team three days to compile the report. Three days! And we're not even sure it was 100% accurate. Plus, we're losing good candidates because our ATS is so slow. Our time-to-hire is averaging 45 days.

[14:02:25] Michael Chen: That must be frustrating. What would you say is your biggest priority right now?

[14:02:32] Jennifer Martinez: Getting everything into one system before our next big expansion. We're opening offices in Singapore and Dubai in Q3, and I can't handle another siloed system.

[14:02:45] Michael Chen: Got it. And what's your timeline for implementing a new solution?

[14:02:52] Jennifer Martinez: We need to be live by August 1st. Our CEO is pretty firm on that deadline.

[14:03:00] Michael Chen: I see your team members are joining. Should we wait for introductions?

[14:03:10] Jennifer Martinez: Yes, here they come...

[14:03:15] Sarah Wong (APAC HR Lead): Hi everyone, Sarah Wong joining from Singapore.

[14:03:20] Marcus Schmidt (EMEA HR Lead): Hello, Marcus Schmidt here from Berlin.

[14:03:25] Jennifer Martinez: Great, we're all here. Michael, can you give us an overview of PeopleFirst?

[14:03:35] Michael Chen: Of course. But first, I'd love to hear from Sarah and Marcus about their specific challenges.

[14:03:45] Sarah Wong: Sure. My biggest issue is compliance. We're in 6 APAC countries, each with different labor laws. Our current system doesn't handle multi-country compliance well. We're manually tracking everything in spreadsheets. Last month we almost missed a crucial reporting deadline in Indonesia because of this.

[14:04:15] Marcus Schmidt: And in EMEA, our biggest challenge is the acquisition integration. We have 2,300 employees still on the old TechVision system. It doesn't handle modern workflows at all. Plus, with GDPR, we're constantly worried about data compliance.

[14:04:45] Michael Chen: Thank you both. Those are exactly the kinds of challenges our platform was built to address. Would you like me to walk you through our solution?

[14:05:00] Jennifer Martinez: Yes, but first - what's your typical implementation timeline for a company our size?

[14:05:08] Michael Chen: For 8,500 employees across multiple regions, we typically need 12-14 weeks for full implementation. However, we can do a phased approach, starting with core HR and adding modules progressively.

[14:05:30] Jennifer Martinez: That could work. Sarah, what's the status of your HR-Link contract?

[14:05:38] Sarah Wong: It expires in July, so timing would be perfect. We're paying about $380,000 annually for it.

[14:05:50] Jennifer Martinez: And Marcus, the TechVision system?

[14:05:55] Marcus Schmidt: We own it, but maintenance is costing us about €290,000 yearly. Plus another €100,000 in custom development work we need this year for compliance updates.

[14:06:15] Michael Chen: Would you like me to walk you through our pricing structure?

[14:06:20] Jennifer Martinez: Yes, but first - tell me about your global compliance features.

[14:06:25] Michael Chen: Of course. Our platform includes compliance templates for 93 countries, with quarterly updates. We automatically track changes in labor laws and notify your team. For example, when Indonesia changed their overtime calculations last year...

[14:06:45] Sarah Wong: That's exactly what caused our issue! How customizable are these templates?

[14:06:52] Michael Chen: Fully customizable. Let me show you a quick demo of our compliance dashboard...

[Time stamp: Demo portion - 14:07:00 to 14:25:30]

[14:25:35] Jennifer Martinez: That's impressive. Marcus, what do you think about the GDPR features?

[14:25:42] Marcus Schmidt: They're comprehensive. Better than what we have now. But what about data hosting? We need EU data to stay in the EU.

[14:25:55] Michael Chen: We have data centers in Frankfurt and Dublin. You can specify data residency requirements by region.

[14:26:10] Jennifer Martinez: Let's talk numbers. What's this going to cost us?

[14:26:15] Michael Chen: For your size and requirements, we're looking at $1.2 million annually. This includes all modules, global compliance updates, custom workflows, and 24/7 support. Implementation would be another $400,000.

[14:26:40] Jennifer Martinez: *pause* That's actually less than we're paying now across all systems. What about training?

[14:26:50] Michael Chen: We provide comprehensive training, both virtual and on-site. For your size, we include 10 days of on-site training at locations of your choice, plus unlimited virtual training for all employees.

[14:27:10] Sarah Wong: What about Chinese language support? We have 400 employees in China.

[14:27:18] Michael Chen: Full support in simplified Chinese, including mobile app and help documentation. We also support Japanese, Korean, and Thai if needed.

[14:27:35] Jennifer Martinez: Good. Now, about implementation - you mentioned 12-14 weeks. Break that down for me.

[14:27:45] Michael Chen: Here's our typical enterprise implementation timeline:
- Weeks 1-2: Discovery and planning
- Weeks 3-4: Data migration setup
- Weeks 5-8: Core HR implementation
- Weeks 9-10: Payroll and compliance setup
- Weeks 11-12: Testing and validation
- Weeks 13-14: User training and go-live

We can run some phases in parallel if needed.

[14:28:15] Jennifer Martinez: And you can guarantee completion by August 1st?

[14:28:20] Michael Chen: Yes, we'll put that in the contract with penalties if we miss the deadline.

[14:28:30] Marcus Schmidt: What about support during European business hours?

[14:28:35] Michael Chen: We have a support center in Dublin that covers EMEA hours. Plus, we'll assign you a dedicated customer success manager in your time zone.

[14:28:50] Jennifer Martinez: Okay, I think we've covered the major points. What are the next steps?

[14:29:00] Michael Chen: I'll send over the full proposal tomorrow, including:
- Detailed pricing breakdown
- Implementation timeline
- SLA guarantees
- Training schedule
- Data migration plan
- Compliance coverage details

Would you also like reference calls with some of our other global clients?

[14:29:25] Jennifer Martinez: Yes, particularly any in tech or with similar size. Sarah, Marcus - any other questions?

[14:29:35] Sarah Wong: Can you include details about the API documentation? Our tech team will want to review it.

[14:29:42] Michael Chen: Of course. I'll include our full API documentation and sample integration guides.

[14:29:50] Marcus Schmidt: And the data residency agreements for EU?

[14:29:55] Michael Chen: Yes, I'll include our standard DPA and data residency agreements.

[14:30:05] Jennifer Martinez: Perfect. Send everything to me, and copy both Sarah and Marcus. We have a board meeting next Thursday - if we can review everything before then, we might be able to get this approved next week.

[14:30:25] Michael Chen: Excellent. When would you like to schedule the technical deep dive with your IT team?

[14:30:35] Jennifer Martinez: Let me check with our CTO... could you hold Tuesday morning EST?

[14:30:42] Michael Chen: Yes, I'll block 9 AM to noon EST on Tuesday.

[14:30:50] Jennifer Martinez: Great. Anything else we need to cover today?

[14:31:00] Sarah Wong: Not from me. Looking forward to reviewing the documentation.

[14:31:05] Marcus Schmidt: Same here. Thanks everyone.

[14:31:10] Jennifer Martinez: Thanks Michael. We'll look for your proposal tomorrow.

[14:31:15] Michael Chen: Thank you all for your time. I'll send over the material by noon EST tomorrow. Have a great rest of your day.
